# Voter Data Project and Examples

![Fact.](/assets/trump-elevator.jpg)

This is an attempt at building out a series of introductory labs in
[KDD, or **K**nowledge **D**iscovery in **D**atabases][kdd]. The words 
"data science" are thrown around a lot, but here it is in full:

1.  Data set selection
2.  Data modeling and architecture
3.  Pre-processing, or "cleaning," data
4.  Data transformation, or ["ETL" (extract-transform-load)][etl]
5.  Statistical modeling
6.  [Data mining][dm]
7.  Data analysis or interpretation
8.  Predictive analysis and ["CEP" (complex-event-processing)][cep]

Many of these are mostly applied skills, some or conceptual, but all 
are a mix, and each is intertwined with the others. That's why
presenting them in a single course of work, themed around a single
domain (or "problem"), and with a unified, clear data set, makes it
a little easier to understand the process as a whole.

### Data

See the [Voter Lists README][voter-lists-readme] and the
[Demographics README][demographics-readme].

### Process and steps

> Imagine it's January 1, 2016. You recieve a call from a friend of an
> old friend, whose heard that you are a "computer person." The caller
> identifies themselves as representing a candidate for national office.
> The candidate is running an insurgent campaign that's had enormous
> and surprising success, but hasn't had the resources or staff to
> create a presence in the crucial state of Ohio. For starters, they are
> going to need a "data game," someone to run the numbers, build the
> models, deploy some applications, and advise on strategy.
>
> You are being offered that job. You're unprepared, but hey, you gotta
> learn somehow… Politics is all about "on the job training," right?
